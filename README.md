## Dependency Injection (DI) - Detailed Notes

### What is Dependency Injection?

- **Dependency Injection (DI)** is a design pattern used to implement Inversion of Control (IoC).
- It allows a class to receive its dependencies from external sources rather than creating them itself.
- This makes code more modular, testable, and maintainable.

### Why Use Dependency Injection?

- **Decoupling:** Reduces tight coupling between classes.
- **Testability:** Makes unit testing easier by allowing mock dependencies.
- **Reusability:** Promotes reuse of components.
- **Maintainability:** Easier to manage and update dependencies.

### Types of Dependency Injection

1. **Constructor Injection**
    - Dependencies are provided through a class constructor.
    - Most common and recommended method.

2. **Setter Injection**
    - Dependencies are set through public setters or properties after object creation.
    - Useful when dependency is optional.

3. **Interface Injection**
    - The dependency provides an injector method that will inject the dependency into any client passed to it.

### Manual Dependency Injection

- You create and provide dependencies manually in your code.
- No external frameworks are used.
- Good for small projects or learning purposes.

#### Example Flow (Conceptual, No Code)

1. **Define Dependencies:**  
   Identify what classes or objects your class depends on.

2. **Provide Dependencies:**  
   Pass dependencies via constructor or setter when creating the object.

3. **Use Dependencies:**  
   The class uses the provided dependencies for its operations.

### Benefits of Manual DI

- Full control over object creation.
- No external libraries required.
- Good for understanding the basics of DI.

### Drawbacks of Manual DI

- Can become complex as the project grows.
- Managing object graphs manually is error-prone.
- Not scalable for large applications.

### Best Practices

- Prefer constructor injection for required dependencies.
- Use interfaces or abstract classes for dependencies to allow flexibility.
- Avoid service locators or static access to dependencies.

### Summary

- DI is a key pattern for writing clean, testable, and maintainable code.
- Manual DI is a good starting point for learning.
- For larger projects, consider using DI frameworks (like Dagger, Hilt, Koin, etc.).
